# Token Contract

Simple ERC20 token contract with additional minting and burning functionalities.

## Description

This contract implements an ERC20 token called NotCoin (symbol: NOT) using OpenZeppelin's library. The contract allows the owner to mint new tokens and any token holder to burn their tokens. It also includes basic transfer functionality with additional checks for zero transfer amounts and sufficient balances.
